I am a fourth-year Government and Politics PhD student at the University of Maryland studying International Relations. My primary interests are in human rights and international organizations. My current work is on the United Nations Security Council's response to mass atrocities. I achieved my Master's degree in Government and Politics from UMD in 2024. Prior to UMD, I received Bachelor's Degrees in Political Science and International Studies from the University of Kentucky. In my free time, I enjoy playing Dungeons and Dragons, exploring DC, and pet-sitting for friends and family.
