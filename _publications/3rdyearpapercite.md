title: "Putting Mass Atrocities on the Agenda: UNSC Response to Mass Atrocities"
collection: publications
category: conferences
excerpt: 'Under what conditions can we expect the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) to respond to mass atrocity events? While previous literature suggests that the UNSC responds based on the severity of the crisis, there is still great variation among cases at the highest levels of severity. While Rwanda received an international criminal tribunal, the atrocities at the end of the Sri Lankan Civil War never made it onto the UNSC agenda. I argue this variation stems from the considerations the Council President must make when setting the UNSC agenda. These considerations include more than the severity of the crisis but the preferences of salient audiences as well, including the target state, the international community, and their co-members of the council. To test my argument, I collected new data on UNSC response to 24 mass atrocities from 1989 to 2024. My findings will offer a framework for understanding the conditions under which the UNSC takes action on mass atrocities. By identifying how member states navigate the competing pressures of internal dynamics and external advocacy, this research provides insights into improving the predictability of UNSC behavior.'
